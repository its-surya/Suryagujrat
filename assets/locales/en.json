  "KARS-para1": "Installing Rooftop Solar PV helps to reduce the electricity bill and results in saving. Rooftop Solar PV panels supply electricity to buildings, so they need to buy less electricity from the grid thereby saving on energy costs and also benefits environment.",
  "KARS-para2": "Rooftop solar is also a great investment tool as electricity prices keep on fluctuating from time to time. So, it is difficult to calculate the expenditure on electricity for a certain period of time. However, when it comes to electricity generated by solar rooftops, the price of power generated can be calculated easily. In fact, one can even calculate the cost of electricity generation for another 10 years. In this way, it is a secure investment.",
